As an experienced data engineer, I can help you better manage your information and find the true value within.  My <span style="font-weight:bold">volunteer</span> services include:</p>

<h3>Data Integration</h3>

<p>Using best-of-breed tools and processes, I will work with your team to design, build, and deploy data <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/06/12/oracle_to_postgres/">extraction, transformation, and loading</a> pipelines that you can rely on.  Under a comprehensive data governance plan, we may also apply <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/07/18/pg_data_virt/">data virtualization</a> and master data management to your critical assets.</p>

<h3>Data Quality</h3>

<p>Drawing on over a decade of experience in data management, I will help you <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/09/05/data_quality/">identify quality problems</a> in your data and deploy cleansing processes so your business users will fully trust your reporting.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Search</h3>

<p>Once your disparate data sources have been integrated and cleansed, we'll deploy a powerful Google-like search capability allowing your business users to quickly access the enterprise data they need, securely in a web browser.</p>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

<p>Gain insights into your trusted data using <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/10/15/data_viz/">business intelligence tools</a> offering rich dashboarding, interactive reporting, and timely alerts sent to your users. Custom development ensures integration with your corporate portal.</p>

<h3>Predictive Analytics</h3>

<p>Using the latest techniques in machine learning, I will rapidly prototype innovative analytic processes to find powerful and actionable insights in your business data.  Once proven, we can promote these analytic pipelines into production.</p>

<h3>Pay As You Go</h3>

<p>All compute resources will be provisioned from cloud-providers using on-demand scaling to meet your business needs, now and in the future.
