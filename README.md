## Using this Template

First clone and rename this repo to [your_github_name].github.io, change the values in _config.yml to yours and then delete my old blog posts from the _posts folder and start adding your own. Commit & push your changes, then view the site, hosted on GitHub Pages, at https://[your_github_name].github.io.

## What's Included

A full Jekyll environment is included with this theme. If you have Jekyll installed, simply run `jekyll serve` in your command line and preview the build in your browser. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.

A Grunt environment is also included. There are a number of tasks it performs like minification of the JavaScript, compiling of the LESS files, adding banners to apply the MIT license, and watching for changes. Run the grunt default task by entering `grunt` into your command line which will build the files. You can use `grunt watch` if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESS.

You can run `jekyll serve --watch` and `grunt watch` at the same time to watch for changes and then build them all at once.
