After discovering a new [cryptocurrency last month]({{site.url}}/04/30/unraid-chia-plotting-farming/), I quickly deployed the command-line only Docker image to my Unraid server.  However, while that functioned, its shortcomings were many:

* Without a GUI, running plotting jobs in parallel relied upon many open Console windows, tmux sessions.
* Keeping up-to-date with status, meant manually trolling through various log files.
* Assessing performance was a challenge given the limited insight into the farming and plotting processes.

Looking around, there were useful tools to improve this, however each required installation and configuration themselves, which took time.  I decided to build my own Docker image with these tools, available to other Unraid users.  

* [Chiaâ„¢](https://www.chia.net/): the distributed cryptocurrency project.
* [Plotman](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman): a parallel plotting manager.
* [Chiadog](https://github.com/martomi/chiadog): a log monitor with alerting.

Building upon the Flask web-server for Python, I tied all these tools together in an easy-to-use package:

As my day-job is exlusively devops backend, it's fun to dabble in front-end coding again.  Not sure where this project will go, but I've submitted Machinaris to the [Unraid repository](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/108896-support-machinaris-chia-cryptocurrency-farming-plotman-plotting-unraid-webui/). As well, some interest has been generated on the [Github project](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris).
