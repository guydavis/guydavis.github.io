Here are some of my notes from the fifth lesson of the [Fast AI course](https://course.fast.ai/).  

## Back Propogation

This lesson took a deep-dive into the inner workings of back propogation, used in previous lessons.  I'm still trying to get my mind wrapped around the power of this step-wise method to exhibit such emergent behavior.  The FastAI and PyTorch libaries were used to good effect to demonstrate the functioning internals.

## Neural Nets

With that knowledge, the instructor took another look at various neural nets, demonstrating the use of backpropogation within.

## Takeaways

1. This is complicated stuff.
2. I need more practice...
