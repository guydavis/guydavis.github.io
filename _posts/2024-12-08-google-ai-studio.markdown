After I completed a [5-day course](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-generative-ai-intensive) last month covering Google's current AI offerings, I wanted to play around in the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) a bit more. In particular, I wanted to check out the Gemini LLM via some prompts.

## Gemini Sample Prompts

Here's an example prompt in the Studio, asking about plantcare based on a photo input.

Along the right side of the studio window, the model's inputs can be tweaked.  For example, the creativity of the response is affected by changing the 'Temperature' value.

The Prompt Gallery had some other interesting prompts, including one showing structured text output:

After my [tests of OCR a few years ago](/2018/03/06/tabular_ocr_gcv), I found the pasted letter image, responded to by Santa Claus an impressive feat:
