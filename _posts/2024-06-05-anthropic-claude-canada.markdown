So, when I last tried to evaluate [Anthropic's Claude LLM](/2024/03/04/anthropic-claude), I learned it wasn't available for Canadians.  After a few months, I received an email telling me I could try Claude up here in the Great White North now.

I started out asking for summer vacation ideas:

Then I asked for ideas local to western Canada:

Seems pretty good at summarizing options, useful as a jumping off point for further research.
