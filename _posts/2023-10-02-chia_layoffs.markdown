In the bad news column for the Chia cryptocurrency, the company (CNI) controlling the reference platform has annoucned [quite large layoffs](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/02/chia-network-lays-off-third-of-its-staff-as-loss-of-banker-delayed-going-public/) and a delay in their efforts to take company public.  

While I can't predict the future, its never a good sign when a software company lays off that many of their developers.  I can't see how this doesn't impact the maintenance, let alone the future development, of their software.  

Anecdotally, as developer of a tool that builds upon their platform, I'm already encountering serious defects that remain open for months and months (indefinitely?). Not a good sign at all.
