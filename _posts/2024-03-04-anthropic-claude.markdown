Not to be left behind in the evolution of large language models (LLMs), tech firm Anthropic has released an [updated version](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) of their Claude digital assistant.  Like other LLMs, Claude offers [summarization, search, creative and collaborative writing, Q&A, and coding](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude).

## Critical Reception

Interestingly, the online consensus seems to be [generally positive](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1bcjdzl/are_you_using_claude_3/) for Claude 3, especially when compared with ChatGPT 4.  Others like the relatively large context window, that should enable better code generation as a programming assistant with larger file ingestion.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

Unfortunately, as a Canadian, I wasn't able to actually try it out due region lockout.  No, I can't be bothered to fire up my VPN to try and circumvent their lock.  If Anthropic can only handle users from certain countries, I'm happy to follow their guidance.

## Conclusions

Again, I'm glad to see more competition in the LLM space.  Ideally they even let those outside the US try it out one day too...
