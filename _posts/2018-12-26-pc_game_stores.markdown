After setting up a [Budget Gaming PC]({{ site.url }}/2018/11/09/budget_pc_gaming) for my young sons a Christmas present, I looked into the various online stores for buying and launching games on Windows 10.  There are alot of different stores, all vying for gamers' attention and dollars.


![Steam]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/pc_game_stores_steam.png)

The largest seems to be Valve's [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) store.  I've purchased the majority of our games through this store, including just about every Lego game as my boys really love those.  While I haven't needed it, I've heard that Valve's support is quite good.


![Epic]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/pc_game_stores_epic.png)

A recent newcomer is [Epic's gamestore](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/), building on the success of their [Fortnite game](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/).  So far, I've only used this to launch Fortnite and also pick up a free copy of [Subnautica](https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/).

![Blizzard]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/pc_game_stores_blizzard.png)

Another contender is the [Battle.net](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/?ref=battle.net) from Blizzard.  I've enjoyed playing [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/) and also [Destiny 2](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/destiny-2), but no doubt World of Warcraft is another big draw for this store.

![GOG]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/pc_game_stores_gog.png)

A DRM-free contender is the [GOG](http://gog.com/) store, however I haven't purchased any games from this one yet.  Keeping an eye on it however.

# Conclusions

There is definitely a lot of choice in the world of PC game stores.  Best bet is to watch for the various sales and pick up games when they're discounted.
