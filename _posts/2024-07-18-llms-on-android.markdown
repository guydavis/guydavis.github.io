So, I've been playing around [Anthropic's Claude LLM](/2024/06/15/anthropic-claude-canada) ever since they released it for us Canadians to use.  Seems like a good option compared to ChatGPT in some situations.  Today, they announced an Android app, so I thought I'd give it a try.  

I've been using the Android app for ChatGPT for a while now.  Here's what it looks like.

Similarly, I started out asking Claude for summer vacation ideas:

Pretty similar.  I'll be using these during our upcoming vacation to help plan activities along the way.
