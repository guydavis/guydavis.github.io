I saw that OpenAI's [ChatGPT](/2022/12/21/chatgpt/) will [become available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/chatgpt-is-now-available-in-azure-openai-service/) on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, probably with additional integration to their Bing search engine soon.

Google seems to have missed out on the deal with OpenAI as they are pushing their [own generative AI](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649794/google-chatgpt-rival-bard-ai-chatbot-access-hands-on), named Bard.

Anybody remember how Google pushed their own "Google Videos" service way back when, before finally declaring defeat and buying out Youtube?  I wonder how this space will mature in the future...
