Following my earlier discussion of [enterprise orchestration]({{ site.url }}/2016/11/25/ent_orchestrators/), I decided to look closer at hosted Kubernetes clusters from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/),  [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough), and [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/heptio-kubernetes/).  To start with, I'll be trying out the free trial of Google Container Engine.

## Getting Started with GCloud

First off, I installed the [GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start) on my workstation, [Ubuntu 16.04](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-debian-ubuntu):

    export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"
    echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
    curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk kubectl
    gcloud init

I then setup API credentials for my `gcloud` CLI.  First I [created a credential](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey), then downloaded the key as JSON:

![create]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_creds.png)

    sudo gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file MyProject-1234325.json

## Create the Kubernetes Cluster

Then in Google Cloud Console, I created the new Kubernetes cluster:

![create]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_create.png)

After creation, the console showed the newly running Kubernetes cluster (3 nodes):

![mycluster]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_mycluster.png)

I then connected from my local kubectl util:

    gcloud container clusters get-credentials mykube --zone us-central1-a --project <project-id>
    kubectl proxy

This opened a local proxy to my Kubernetes cluster's Admin Dashboard:

![deploy]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_deploy.png)

Which I then scaled from one to three pods with:

    kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/nginx-test

![deployment]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_nginx.png)

Since, I'd set the `nginx-test` deployment to be available as an external service on the Kubernetes clsuter, I could view it in a browser from my workstation:

![nginx]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_nginx_external.png)

For more useful Kubernetes commands, see the `kubectl` [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_completion/).

## Monitoring and Logging

Google Cloud makes it easy to add both [monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/) and [logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/) of your Kubernetes cluster.  For example, I could quickly find Nginx events from the launched pods:  

![logging]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_logging.png)

The monitoring dashboard allows one to see CPU, memory, and disk usage (example below):

![monitoring]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/kube_gke_monitoring.png)

Stackdriver is free for GCP VM monitoring and email alerts.  A premium tier offers combined monitoring of AWS instances as well, plus notifications in Slack, PagerDuty and more. 

## Summary

After evaluating various container orchestrators and cloud providers, I'm now convinced that:

1. Distributed container orchestrators are the next operating system... required knowledge for software developers.
2. As the leader in developer mind-share, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) has become the API to deploy against, offering portability amongst cloud providers.
3. Use managed clusters, like [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/), rather than spending your time on bare-bones VMs.

Software development best practice is now containerized deployments on an industry-standard orchestator, run by your preferred cloud platform.
