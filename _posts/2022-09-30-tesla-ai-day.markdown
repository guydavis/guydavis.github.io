Tesla held an [AI presentation today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSJsviD_SU), here's the [transcript](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/09/27/tesla-ai-day-2022-everything-you-need-to-know/?sh=696187417388).  Highlights included a new robot platform, improvements to self driving, and a new supercomputer.

# Optimus Robot

So, they are previewing a humanoid robot.  Looked kind of neat, but pretty early stages, particularly as compared to existing robots like [Atlas](https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas) from Boston Dynamics that can run and jump.  Musk himself closed this section by saying their robot will be very powerful in a decade. I'll check back then.

# Full Self Driving

Promised many years ago, Tesla is further improving their "full self driving" functionality in their cars.  Their current software is [likely level-2, at best level-3](https://www.drive.com.au/news/tesla-full-self-driving-level-2-autonomous/), on a 5-level automous driving scale.  Tesla and competitors will eventually be able to improve their self-driving, particularly by adding more video/lidarr data and more compute, however it may take many more years.

# Dojo

With respect to their ML compute, they showed "Dojo" a cabinet-based system for modularly extending systems to build a supercomputer.  Again, seems like [Google](https://www.google.ca/about/datacenters/) and others have been here before, but I competition is always good.

# Conclusion

All this seems neat, we'll have to see what turns out to be real and what is vaporware I suppose.
