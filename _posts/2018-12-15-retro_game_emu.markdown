After setting up an Nvidia Shield on our upstairs TV last month, I heard that it was a great platform for playing retro console games.

# Build or Buy?

With a great pricing matching policy, I knew I would be purchasing from our local retailer, Memory Express.  The main question

# AMD or Intel?
In late 2018, 

# Research Tools
* Reddit forums including:
* PC Part Picker: 
* Youtube channels including: Hardware Unboxed, Tech Deals, and Tech Ephiphany

# Conclusions

The biggest benefit of a simple gaming PC was that our upgrade choices are still open in coming months and years.  For example, will we make good use of this PC or will it gather dust like our old Nintendo Wii?  By starting with a cheap system, it's not a big deal if the boys turn out to not be interested in PC gaming.

On the other hand, if the gaming PC gets lots of use and we want to play more challenging titles in the future, requiring a real GPU, what is our best upgrade option?
* Buy an Nvidia GTX GPU and possibly Gamestream to the Nvida Shield?
* Or buy a AMD Radeon GPU, ensuring compatibility with our freesync-capable monitor?
Combine that uncertainty with the benefit of waiting for newer/better/cheaper technology by waiting a year, including potential AM4 CPU upgrades, gives us the best of PC gaming... upgradability.
