After setting up a [budget gaming PC]({{ site.url }}/2018/11/09/budget_pc_gaming) last month, I've been investigating emulation for retro console games.

# Emulators on Windows 10

There are a number of different emulators available on Windows 10 for all sorts of games.

## Retroarch

On the PC, I'm using the [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/) frontend for older ROMs such as Nintendo Gamecube and Sega Genesis.  The default Retroarch UI is built for set-top boxes and is fairly non-intuitive on the PC.  There is a secondary UI for PC, but it is limited.  Keyboard controls often take quite a lot of trial and error to discover.

## Citra

Given the importance my kids put on Pokemon games, the [Citra emulator](https://citra-emu.org/) for Nintendo DS/3DS is a great.  Controls work well out of the box and the ability to scale up from native resolution with still decent framerates is very nice.  

## Dolphin

The[Dolphin emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) for Wii games seems to work pretty well.  As always, the first few minutes of playing a game is spent randomly typing keys to determine the control mapping.   

## Cemu

While I have lots of hope for this one day supporting AMD GPUs, right now I am unable to get any Nintendo Wii-U playing on latest [Cemu](https://dolphin-emu.org/). It just black-screens for me in all games. 

## ppspp

[PPSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) is a good emulator for PSP games. 

## espxe

[eSPXe](http://www.epsxe.com/) is a good emulator for PSX games.

## pcsx2

[PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) is a good emulator for PS2 games.

# Emulators Shield TV

## Retroarch

The [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/) frontend is a common UI for a number of backend emulator cores, supporting emulation of Nintendo, Playstation, and other many others.  I've personally found Retroarch to have poor default controller configurations, requiring a lot of tweaking to use.  For that reason, I often look for a better specific emulator such as these below.

## Drastic

Available via the Google Play store, the [Drastic DS emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsemu.drastic&hl=en) allows one to run Nintendo DS ROMs on the Shield TV.  I've found it has better support for the Shield game controllers out of the box and does a good job with most Nintendo DS ROMs.

## ARC Browser

Another emulator frontend is the [ARC Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.floatingpoint.android.arcturus).  I hope to have more time to try this in the future.

# Conclusions

With all these various emulators floating around for both Windows PC and Shield TV, it's handy to find a nice game browser (aka launcher) that lists them in a single view.  On the Windows PC, my preferred launcher is [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/).  It offers a nice means of launching into each game directly by invoking the correct emulator command.
