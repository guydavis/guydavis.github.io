As part of explorations into machine learning, I've been brushing up on computer science basics starting with linear algebra.  Nice to see good old [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) again after so many years.

> An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that multiplication by A alters only the scale of v:

```
      Av = λv
```

> The scalar λ is known as the eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector.
