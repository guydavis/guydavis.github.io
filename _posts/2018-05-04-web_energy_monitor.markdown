Back in 2011, we moved into a newly built home here in Calgary.  We'd done our best to build an energy-efficient house, but I wanted a way to monitor it over time.  I came across the [Web Energy Logger](http://welserver.com/).  It's been a while now, but I'm still able to monitor:
* Temperatures - both indoors and out, air and water.
* Water flow - for domestic usage and for in-floor heating
* Pump activations - for our ground-source heat pump (GSHP)
* Ventilation runs - for our heat recovery ventilator (HRV)

# Conclusion
Overall, I've been pleased with the system, particularly when we moved in during the late fall..  Being able to monitor heat distribution to the floors actually helped us determine the source of initial draftiness.  Turned out that builder had forgot to blow insulation into our attic!  Ooops.  They fixed it right up when we found out though.  All good now.
